# Coursera Courses Exercises Repository

This repository contains my exercises, assignments, and notes from various Coursera courses I have taken. The content is organized by topic and week, including Jupyter notebooks, datasets, and supporting files used throughout the courses.

## Structure

- Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or module from a Coursera course.
- Jupyter notebooks contain code, analysis, and documentation for each exercise.
- Additional files such as datasets and reference materials are included as needed.

## Usage

You can browse the folders to find exercises and notes for different data science topics. Open the Jupyter notebooks with JupyterLab or VS Code to view and run the code.

## Purpose

This repository serves as a personal archive of my learning journey on Coursera and may be useful for others looking for examples or inspiration for their own studies.
